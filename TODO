Fucking program the whole thing

    1. So I think reddit scraper is good to go i just need to put that its own
    class / file

    2. instagram shit is probably fine, Just need to put it into its own class 
    and give it its own account object
    
    3. I need to build the scheduler object
        What it would probably look like.  

        - Start up sequence
            -logs into instagram accounts, SLOWLY, not all at once and avoid fully ip banned
            -Creates schedule 
        - I would want it to run at like 5:00 AM or something where firstly
             1. schedules the scrapes for reddit. spaced evenly throughout day
             2. Schedules the posts for each active account. ~15-30 posts



    !--Implement instagram ffmpeg croping 

    

    Tiktok integration later

    
    decisions made:   
        -Nobody fucking likes picture posts anymore, people just scroll through reels so we are only scraping videos
